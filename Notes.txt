The command to initialize a go project is: go mod init SampleDatabase
To install the sqlite3 driver I needed to enter the command: go get github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3
To connect to GitHub through ssh as KersteinS I had to add a config file to .ssh, and I had to set the origin URL to [host for KersteinS in config]:KersteinS/SampleDatabase.git
